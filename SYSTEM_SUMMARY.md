# üè† Bengaluru House Price Prediction - Complete System Summary

## ‚úÖ **SYSTEM STATUS: WORKING PERFECTLY**

All issues have been resolved! The system is now fully functional with both frontend and backend working correctly.

---

## ü§ñ **MODELS USED IN THE SYSTEM**

### **1. Web Application (app.py)**
- **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Linear Regression**
- **Dynamic model selection** based on prediction stability
- **Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP**: Every prediction is explained with force, waterfall, and summary plots

---

## üåê **FRONTEND & BACKEND ARCHITECTURE**

### **Backend (Flask API)**
- Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Model Training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Linear Regression)
- REST API Endpoint: /predict
- Form Data Handling
- JSON Response Generation
- **SHAP Explainability**: Generates force, waterfall, and summary plots for each prediction

### **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**
- Responsive Design (Bootstrap)
- Animated, uniform cards for model outputs (with icons and badges)
- Four main graphs: Model vs. Predicted Price, Model Proportion Pie Chart, Model Consensus, Feature Importance
- SHAP explainability section with force, waterfall, and summary plots
- Beautiful UI/UX

---

## üß† **Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP**

After every prediction, the app generates:
- **SHAP Force Plot**: Shows how each feature pushed the prediction up or down for your input.
- **SHAP Waterfall Plot**: Visualizes the additive contributions of each feature to the final prediction.
- **SHAP Summary Plot**: Shows the overall importance of each feature across the dataset.

These plots help users understand why the model made its prediction, increasing trust and transparency.

## üöÄ **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### **Web Application (Recommended)**
```bash
python app.py
# Then visit: http://localhost:5000
```
