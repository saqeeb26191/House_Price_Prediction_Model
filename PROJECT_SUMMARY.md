# Bengaluru House Price Prediction - Project Summary

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Modern Web App**: Animated, uniform cards for model predictions, each with a model icon and a "Best" badge for the most stable model.
- **Multiple Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Most stable model is chosen based on consensus.
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Four main graphs—Model vs. Predicted Price, Model Proportion Pie Chart, Model Consensus, Feature Importance.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP**: Every prediction is explained with force, waterfall, and summary plots.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing.

## 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP

After every prediction, the app generates:
- **SHAP Force Plot**: Shows how each feature pushed the prediction up or down for your input.
- **SHAP Waterfall Plot**: Visualizes the additive contributions of each feature to the final prediction.
- **SHAP Summary Plot**: Shows the overall importance of each feature across the dataset.

These plots help users understand why the model made its prediction, increasing trust and transparency.
