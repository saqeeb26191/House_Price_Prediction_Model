## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Machine Learning solution for predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, multiple model comparison, feature importance analysis, and **explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP** for dynamic model selection and transparency.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature engineering
- **Multiple ML Models**: Compares 4 different algorithms
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Fair comparison based on actual performance, not assumptions
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation and multiple metrics
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of key factors affecting house prices
- **Interactive Predictions**: Sample prediction functionality with all models
- **Prediction Statistics**: Shows range, mean, and model consensus
- **Modern UI**: Animated, uniform cards for model outputs with icons and badges
- **Insightful Graphs**: Predicted price, pie chart, consensus, and feature importance
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: SHAP force plot, waterfall plot, and summary plot for every prediction

## üß† Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP

After every prediction, the app generates:
- **SHAP Force Plot**: Shows how each feature pushed the prediction up or down for your input.
- **SHAP Waterfall Plot**: Visualizes the additive contributions of each feature to the final prediction.
- **SHAP Summary Plot**: Shows the overall importance of each feature across the dataset.

These plots help users understand why the model made its prediction, increasing trust and transparency.

## üìà Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble tree-based model
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble learning
4. **XGBoost** - Optimized gradient boosting

- Feature engineering (bedroom extraction, location frequency)
- Data scaling for appropriate models

### 3. Model Training & Comparison
- Training 4 different ML models
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

## üìà Model Performance

Based on typical results from this dataset:

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | Best For |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| XGBoost | ~0.85-0.90 | ~25-30 | Often highest R¬≤ score |
| Random Forest | ~0.83-0.88 | ~27-32 | Good balance of performance and interpretability |
| Gradient Boosting | ~0.82-0.87 | ~28-33 | Robust performance |
| Linear Models | ~0.60-0.75 | ~35-45 | Baseline comparison |

**Note**: The actual "best" model for each prediction is determined dynamically based on the specific property characteristics and model consensus.

## üéØ Key Insights

### Most Important Features
1. **Total Square Footage** - Primary driver of house prices
2. **Location** - Significant impact on pricing
3. **Number of Bedrooms** - Important factor for family homes
4. **Number of Bathrooms** - Luxury indicator
5. **Area Type** - Different pricing for different area types

### Price Patterns
- **Location Premium**: Certain areas command significantly higher prices
- **Size Relationship**: Non-linear relationship between size and price
- **Luxury Features**: Additional bathrooms and balconies add value
- **Market Uncertainty**: Prediction ranges show inherent market volatility

### Dynamic Model Selection
- **Most Stable Model**: Prediction closest to the average of all models
- **Model Consensus**: Range of predictions indicates market uncertainty
- **User Empowerment**: All predictions displayed for informed decisions
- **No Bias**: All models treated equally in selection process

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Models
```python
# In the train_models method, add new models to the models dictionary
models = {
    'Your Model': YourModelClass(),
    # ... existing models
}
```

### Feature Engineering
```python
# In preprocess_data method, add new features
df['new_feature'] = # your feature engineering logic

param_grid = {'parameter': [values]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
```

## üìù Sample Usage

```python
from house_price_prediction import HousePricePredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = HousePricePredictor('Bengaluru_House_Data.csv')

# Run complete analysis
